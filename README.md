TARE.STUDY is a smart platform designed to support teachers by enabling them to:
* Visualize classroom performance, including student averages and activities.
* Receive detailed weekly performance reports.
* Select notes, prompts, or SEP books, and automatically generate teaching plans and exams with difficulty levels adjusted to the group's performance.
  

We built TARE.STUDY using a combination of modern web technologies and AI tools:

* Backend: Node.js and Express for server-side operations.
* Frontend: React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* Database: MongoDB for storing user data, course information, and generated PDFs.
* AI Integration: OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for generating personalized teaching plans and exams.
* PDF Handling: Libraries like pdf-lib to create and manage PDF files for reports and exams.
